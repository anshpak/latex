% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution:

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.

\section{Approximations of identity on $\bbR^d$}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[<+->]\frametitle{}

Consider the function $\varphi\in L^1(\rd)$ and its dilatations
\begin{equation}\label{eqDilatationsOfFunction}
\varphi_t(x)=t^{-d}\varphi\brac{\frac{x}{t}},\quad t>0.
\end{equation}

\pause

The convolutions of the form
\begin{equation}\label{eqApproximationsOfIdentity}
(f\ast \varphi_t) (x)=\int\limits_{\rd }\varphi_t(x-y)f(y)\,dy
\end{equation}
usually called \textbf{approximations of identity}.

\pause


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[<+->]\frametitle{}
	
If the normalization condition is fulfilled
\begin{equation}\label{eqIntOfPhiEqualTo1}
\int\limits_{\rd }\varphi(y)\,dy=1,
\end{equation}
then for any function $f\in C_0(\rd )$ the convolution $f\ast \varphi_t $ converges $t\to+0$ to $f$ uniformly on $\rd$.

\pause

Moreover
\begin{equation*}%\label{eq}
\lim_{t\to+0}\norm{f-f\ast \varphi_t }{L^p(\rd )}=0.
\end{equation*}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[<+->]\frametitle{}
	
In the study of convergence almost everywhere, an important role is played by the condition of summability of the radial majorant
\begin{equation}\label{eqRadialMajorantIsSummable}
\no{\varphi}\in L^1(\rd ),\quad \no{\varphi}(x)=\sup\{|\varphi(y)|:|y|\ge |x|\}.
\end{equation}

\pause

\begin{theorem}\label{thConvergenceOfAIAlmostEverywhere}
	%\index[words]{теорема!}
	Let the function $\varphi$ на $\rd $ satisfy the conditions (\ref{eqIntOfPhiEqualTo1}) and (\ref{eqRadialMajorantIsSummable}). Then for any function $f\in L^p(\rd )$, $1\le p<\infty$,
	\begin{equation}\label{eqConvergenceOfAI}
	\lim_{t\to+0}(f\ast \varphi_t )(x)=f(x)
	\end{equation}
	for almost all $x\in\rd $.
\end{theorem}

\pause

In the theorem \ref{thConvergenceOfAIAlmostEverywhere} the <<radial>> convergence can be replaced by <<nontangential>>, that is, we can replace  $\lim_{t\to+0}$ by
\begin{equation*}%\label{eq}
D(x)-\lim,\quad\text{where}\quad D(x)=\{(y,t):|x-y|<at\}
\end{equation*}
for any $a>0$.

The Steklov means
\begin{equation*}%\label{eq}
\varphi(x)=c_d\chi_{B(0,1)}(x),\quad c_d=\frac{1}{\mes{B(0,1)}},

The Poisson kernel

P(x)=c_d(1+|x|^2)^{-\frac{d+1}{2}},\quad c_d=\pi^{\frac{d+1}{2}}\Gamma\brac{\frac{d+1}{2}}.
\end{equation*}
he constant $c_d$ chosen so that the normalization condition (\ref{eqIntOfPhiEqualTo1}) is satisfied.

\pause

The dilations
\begin{equation}\label{eqRepresentationOfPoissonKernel}
P_t(x)=t^{-d}P\brac{\frac{x}{t}}=c_d\frac{t}{(t^2+|x|^2)^{\frac{d+1}{2}}}
\end{equation}
of function $P$ are called \textbf{the Poisson kernel} of upper hal fspace
\begin{equation*}%\label{eq}
\bbR^{d+1}_{+}=\fbrac{(x,t): x\in\rd ,\quad t>0}. 
\end{equation*}
They are related to the Laplace equation $\Delta u=0$.

\textbf{The Gauss--Weierstrass kernel}

W_t(x)=t^{-d}W\brac{\frac{x}{t}}=c_dt^{-d}\exp\brac{-\frac{|x|^2}{4t^2}}
\end{equation*}
are connected with heat equation.

\section{Metric spaces}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[<+->]\frametitle{}

When studying similar questions on metric spaces, it is not very right, perhaps, to consider the special shape of the kernels. It is more natural to clarify the conditions under which one or another type of convergence takes place.

\pause

More precisely, we consider the following questions. What are the conditions for

1) the family of kernels functions as an approximation of identity, 

2)what is the shape of the domains over which the function has a limit almost everywhere (Fatou property)?

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[<+->]\frametitle{}

Let $X$ be у metric space with the metric $d$ and Borel measrure $\mu$, 

\pause

\begin{equation*}
B(x,r)=\{y\in X:d(x,y)<r\},
\end{equation*}
is open ball with center at the point $x\in X$ and the radius $r>0$, and assume always that measure of any ball $B\subset X$ is positive and finite. 

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[<+->]\frametitle{}
	
We will assume that the doubling condition is satisfied, that is, there is such a number $a_{\mu}>0$, that
\begin{equation}\label{eqDoublingCondition}
\mu(B(x,2r))\le a_{\mu}\mu(B(x,r)),\quad  x\in X,\quad  r>0.
\end{equation}

\pause

It will provide us with standard $L^p$-inequalities for Hardy--Littlewood maximal functions. 

The regularity condition of the measure $\mu$ ensures the density of the class of continuous functions in spaces  $L^p(X)$, $1\le p<\infty$.

\section{Approximations of identity on metric measure spaces}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[<+->]\frametitle{}

We consider families of integral operators
\begin{equation}\label{eqIntegralOperators}
\Phi_tf(x)=\int_{X}\varphi_t(x,z)f(z)\dmu(z),
\end{equation}
where the kernels $\varphi_t:X\times X\to\bbR$, $t>0$ forms approximation of identity, 

\pause

that is the following conditions are fulfilled: $\varphi_t\in L^{\infty}(X\times X)$,

\begin{equation}\label{eqIntegralOfPhiTIs1}
\int_{X}\varphi_t(x,z)\dmu(z)=1\quad\text{for all}\quad x\in X,\; t>0,
\end{equation}

\pause

\begin{equation}\label{eqIntegralsPhiTYAreBounded}
\sup_{t\in(0,1)}\sup_{x\in X}\int_X|\varphi_t(x,y)|\dmu(y)<\infty,
\end{equation}

\pause

\begin{equation}\label{eqIntegralsPhiTYOverCBTendsTo0}
\sup_{x\in X}\int_{d(x,y)>\delta}|\varphi_t(x,y)|\dmu(y)\to0\quad\text{if}\quad t\to+0\quad\delta>0,
\end{equation}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[<+->]\frametitle{}
	
The first question is solved simply and it is well known. 
	
The conditions \eqref{eqIntegralOfPhiTIs1}--\eqref{eqIntegralsPhiTYOverCBTendsTo0} are assumed to be fulfilled. Under these conditions, for any continuous function $f\in C(X)$
\begin{equation*}%\label{eq}
\Phi_tf(y)\to f(x)\quad\text{uniformly on } x\in X\;\text{ if } (y,t)\to (x,0).
\end{equation*}

\pause

That means $\Phi_tf$ is approximation of identity.	

\pause

We will focus on the Fatou property.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[<+->]\frametitle{}

Let the function $\lambda:(0,1]\to(0,1]$, $\lambda(+0)=0$ be given. It defines the approach domains to the points on <<boundary>> of the abstract half space  $X\times(0,1]$
\begin{equation*}%\label{eq}
D_{\lambda}(x)=\{(y,t)\in X\times(0,1]:d(x,y)<\lambda(t)\}
\end{equation*}

\pause

Introduce the corresponding maximal operator
\begin{equation*}%\label{eq}
\caN_{\lambda}u(x):=\sup\{|u(y,t)|:(y,t)\in D_{\lambda}(x)\}
\end{equation*}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[<+->]\frametitle{}

We need the following additional condition on the measure $\mu$: there exists two constants $C_1,C_2>1$ such that 
\begin{equation}\label{eqComparatibilityOfBallMeasures}
\mu(B(x,C_1r))\ge C_2\mu(B(x,r)),\quad x\in X,\;r>0.
\end{equation}

\pause

This condition does not seem very strong.	
	
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[<+->]%\frametitle{}

For further we need a new majorant
\begin{equation}\label{eqPhiStar}
\varphi_t^*(x,y):=\sup\{|\varphi_t(x,z)|:d(x,y)\le d(x,z)\},
\end{equation}

\pause

	%\caption{}}\label{fg}
\end{figure}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[<+->]\frametitle{}

To study convergence almost everywhere we will use the following condition
\begin{equation}\label{eqLiNormOfPhiStar}
C_{\varphi}:=\sup_{t\in(0,1)}\sup_{x\in X}\norm{\varphi_t^*(x,\cdot)}{L^{1}(X)}<\infty,
\end{equation}	
which replaces the corresponding condition for a majorant in $\bbR^d$	
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[<+->]\frametitle{}
	
\begin{theorem}\label{thEstimateOfFatouMaximalOperator}
	Let the conditions \eqref{eqDoublingCondition} and \eqref{eqComparatibilityOfBallMeasures} are fulfilled. If the function $\lambda$ satisfy the following condition
	\begin{equation}\label{eqMainCondition}
	C_{\lambda}:=\sup_{t\in(0,1)}\sup_{x\in X}\norm{\varphi_t^*(x,\cdot)}{L^{\infty}(X)}\mu(B(x,\lambda(t)))<\infty,
	\end{equation}
	then

	\begin{equation*}%\label{eq}
	\mu\brac{\{\caN_{\lambda}(\Phi_tf)>A\}}\les\dfrac{C_{\varphi}+C_{\lambda}}{A}\norm{f}{L^1(X)},\quad A>0,\;f\in L^1(X),
	\end{equation*}	
	and for any function $f\in L^1(X)$
	\begin{equation}\label{eqFatouConvergence}
	D_{\lambda}(x)-\lim \Phi_tf=f(x)\quad\text{for almost all}\quad x\in X.
	\end{equation}	
\end{theorem}
	
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[<+->]\frametitle{}

We say that $x\in X$ is the Lebesgue point of the function  $f\in L^1(X)$, if
\begin{equation*}%\label{eq}
\lim_{t\to+0}\fint\limits_{B(x,t)}|f(y)-f(x)|\,d\mu(y)=0.
\end{equation*}	
	
\pause

\begin{theorem}\label{thConvergenceAtLebesguePoints}
	Under conditions \eqref{eqDoublingCondition}, \eqref{eqComparatibilityOfBallMeasures} and function $\lambda$ with property \eqref{eqMainCondition}, for any function $f\in L^1(X)$ we have
	\begin{equation*}%\label{eq}
	D_{\lambda}(x)-\lim \Phi_tf=f(x)
	\end{equation*}	
	at any Lebesgue point $x\in X$.

Let
\begin{equation*}%\label{}
p(z,\theta)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\cdot\frac{1-|z|^2}{|z-e^{i\theta}|^2}
\end{equation*}
be Poisson kernel in the unit circle $B$ of complex plane.	
	
\pause

A study of the convolutions with degrees of the Poisson kernel
\begin{equation}\label{eqPoissonIntegralWithExponent}
P_{l}f(z)=\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\left[p(z,\theta)\right]^{l+\frac{1}{2}}f(\theta)\,d\theta,\;\;
l\ge0
\end{equation}
was initiated by Sj\"ogren, 1984.
	
\pause

It is interesting because
$P_{l}(z,\cdot)$ (and $P_{l}f(z)$) satisfy the following equation
\begin{equation*}%\label{}
\frac{1}{4}(1-|z|^2)^2\left(\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial
	x^2}+\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2}\right)=
\left(l^2-\frac{1}{4}\right)u

\begin{equation}\label{eqNormedPoissonIntegralWithExponent}
\mathcal{P}_{l}f(z)=\frac{P_{l}f(z)}{P_{l}1(z)}

For $l>0$ boundary behaviour of the integrals ${\mathcal P}_{l}f(z)$ is the same as for $l=\frac{1}{2}$:

Fatou domains are

\begin{frame}[<+->]\frametitle{}
	
The case of $l=0$ is different: ${\mathcal P}_{l}f(z)$ converges to $f(e^{i\varphi})$, for every function $f\in L^1[-\pi,\pi]$ for almost all $\varphi\in[-\pi,\pi]$, if $z$ tends $e^{i\varphi}$ inside the domain
